# BackPainDataset


The lower back can be painful due to a variety of problems related to the complex network of muscles, nerves, discs, bones, and tendons that support the spine. Typical sources of low back pain include:

- Nerve roots going to the legs that are located in the low back could be irritated
- Nerves supplying the lower back may be irritated
- An erector spinae (a large pair of muscles arranged in the lower back) may be strained
- It is possible for bones, ligaments, or joints to be damaged
- There may be a degenerative disc in the spine
- There are several structures that can begin to irritate and cause pain in the lower back and/or pain that originated elsewhere in the body. Back muscle spasms are also common with lower back problems, which may not seem serious but can be destructive.

The symptoms and severity of lower back pain vary widely, despite the fact that lower back pain is extremely common. A simple lower back muscle strain might be painful enough to require an emergency room visit, while a degenerating disc might cause only mild discomfort.

This data set is about identifying a person is abnormal or normal using collected physical spine details/data.

Also, in this dataset, we tried some clustering methods as well.
